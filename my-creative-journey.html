      <h2>My Creative Journey</h2>
      <p>Since I was a kid, I’ve loved art — it's been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember. Whether I was doodling in the margins of my notebooks or crafting clothes for my dolls, creativity has always been my way of connecting with the world.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Where It All Started</h3>
        <p>My journey into the creative world began with simple drawings and a curiosity for color. Over the years, that spark grew into a deep love for fashion, visual storytelling, and design. I was especially inspired by how art can be both expressive and functional — telling stories, honoring culture, and making bold statements.</p>

        <h3>Growing Through Experience</h3>
        <p>From school projects to independent passion work, I’ve explored a wide range of mediums — from illustration and textiles to digital design. Every step has taught me something new, and every piece has been a chance to refine my voice as a designer.</p>

        <h3>What Keeps Me Going</h3>
        <p>What drives me today is the belief that art and design have the power to shape narratives, inspire change, and bring people together. I want my work to not only reflect my personal journey but also uplift the stories and identities of others through bold visuals and thoughtful design.</p>
